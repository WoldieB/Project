1. Project Name: Online Shopping Cart Application

2. Introduction:
   - This project is an Online Shopping Cart Application that allows users to add products to their cart and calculate the total price of their order. 
   - Author: Woldie B
3. Installation:
Scenario: You've provided the user with a Python script file (e.g., shopping_cart.py).
Instructions:
Prerequisites: The user needs to have Python 3.12  installed on their system (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Steps:
Open a terminal or command prompt window.
Navigate to the directory where the Python script is saved. You can use the cd command (e.g., cd Documents/MyPythonProjects).
Run the script using the python command followed by the filename (e.g., python shopping_cart.py).


4. Usage:
   The program will greet you with a welcome message and display a list of available products with numbered options (1, 2, etc.) and their prices.
You'll be prompted to enter the number of the product you want to add to your cart.
Enter the corresponding number from the list (e.g., 1 for Apple, 2 for Banana, etc.).
If the input is invalid (not a number or outside the product list range), the program will display an error message asking you to try again.
Once you enter a valid product number, you'll be prompted to enter the quantity you want to purchase.
The program will add the chosen product and quantity to the cart.
You can continue adding more products by repeating steps 2 and 3.
To finish shopping, type done (all lowercase) when prompted for the product number.
The program will calculate the total price of all items in your cart and display it.
